## Project Overview

  * Gain familiarity with and use HTML elements, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for web scraping.
  * Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
  * Create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
  * Create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
  * Create an HTML/CSS portfolio to showcase projects.
  * Use Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio.

## Resources

  * Data Source: https://mars.nasa.gov/news; https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars
  * Software: Python 3.7.6, Anaconda 4.8.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3, Visual Studio Code, 1.46.1, mongo 4.4.0

## Challenge Overview
The goal is to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemispheres images.

  * Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and scrape high-resolution images.
  * Use a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
  * Update the web application and Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
  * Use Bootstrap to style the web app.

#### Extension

  * Update your web app to use more Bootstrap 3 components. The grid system needs to be used so your website will respond to different devices (such as a         phone,tablet, or computer)
  * Include at least three other Bootstrap 3 components from this list (Links to an external site.). Examples include:
    * Adding a button that redirects users to the homepage of the web app.
    * Adding the hemisphere images as thumbnails
    * Customizing the facts table using a Bootstrap table

## Summary
I updated my web app to include the images and title of the four hemispheres i scraped from https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars and used MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape. I also used bootstrap to style the web app.
